			   <h5 class="text-justify"><em>After having a squabble with the manager at Taurian World School in Ranchi, Jharkhand, I decided it's time to leave the school. In brief, I had no idea why I was staying there and what I was fighting for, am I here for my learners' sake? Keeping staying there is a bad idea since I could not answer all of my questions. When I was working for AIESEC in Vietnam, I was already experienced the "sluggish Indian", as I said, they were considered to be unproductive and inefficient at work, or anything in their lives. Indeed, it's time to leave, I told myself.</em></h5>
			   <br>
			   <p class="text-justify">
				   However, right away at the time I made my mind to leave, an unprecedented idea just came up in my mind, instead of coming back home as a loser, why I would not take advantage of my remaining Visa here, I got at least 4 months left to stay here in India, why I need to come back to Vietnam so early though? Two nights before the departure, I installed Couchsurfing app in my phone, created a simple profile then I dropped a message to all the potential host in Ranchi, Jharkhand. Eventually, I got accepted by one host, what a fortune! And that’s the first opportunity leading me to my hitchhiking journey across Northern India, from Kolkata to Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh. Until now, I still could not believe that I could make it to Dharamshala just by asking local people for a lift, but I guess, life finds its way.
				   <br><br>
					During the time hitchhiking from the East to the Northwest of India, I was also applying for volunteering by researching on Lonely Planet, using my skills acquired when I was working for AIESEC Vietnam, I got my application sent to all of the most well-known NGOs in India in two days. Later, a couple of accepting emails have been received by my inbox. At first, I want to volunteer in the mountainous area of Northwestern India as I watched all the movies about this location, one of those is the famous “The Three Idiots” by Amir Khan. For your information, the school at the last scene of this movie was based on a real innovative school model named Druk Padma Karpo School in Shey, Ladakh. However, the school would not accept the volunteer in the Winter season due to the extreme weather this area experiences at the end of the year and I was applying to work for them as expected from December 2019. As an education enthusiast, I was much disappointed by an unwanted condition given by an objective reason like this.
				   <br><br>
					And there came an invitation letter from Karma Lekshe Tsomo from Jamyang Foundation, and I was very much hooked by the hospitality of her words. Actually, at the end of my hitchhiking journey, at a host house in Himachal Pradesh, my left foot was severely infected by a growing wound not being taken care of diligently back in the days in Rishikesh. To be honest, my mental state was a bit down at that time since I constantly pushing myself off the limit for the last 2 months of hitchhiking by living a down-trodden life as a nomad. Finally, I decided to book a train ticket from Chandigarh back to Gaya then came to Sanghamitra Institute in Bodh Gaya as I also got a Couchsurfing host, I called my second family in India living in Gaya, perhaps, I can stay at his home for a couple of days before moving to the monastery.		   
				  <br><br>
					The father’s host took me to the municipal hospital nearly to get me operated and I can still recall how painful it was during the procedure. A week later, I was accompanied by Rohit, the Couchsurfing host, to the monastery. In short, I came to Jamyang Foundation as almost a patient, not a volunteer. However, I was welcomed by all the nuns there, since I could not move around much in a couple of first few days, all the nuns were taking a turn to bring me the meal and made sure that I got all the basic living conditions satisfied. I was extremely moved and thankful for having their support.
				   <br><br>
					For my work, I still tried my best to commit to the teaching schedule arranged among all the volunteers as I also could feel the pride I took when I was doing my work well. So far, I was much re-energized by doing what I love and there is no reason that I want to prohibit myself from doing if I can perform best at work. Not understanding Hindi as the medium language is also a disadvantage while teaching to the little nuns as for them, English is their second language. Leading me to a scenario that very often I changed my teaching approaches and materials to adapt the most to each comprehensive level of every group of nuns. 
				   <br><br>
					Regarding the youngest group, I got the two youngest nuns who just arrived at the monastery a couple of days earlier. Their background is quite common for Indian children living in a small county whose locals there don’t use English to communicate as New Delhi or Mumbai. As we could not use a medium language to communicate to others, my strategy was just to keep them entertained and engaged in my work of English, it could be just a random day drawing chalks on the ground, instructing them to play some simple games or having a time watching butterflies inside the monastery. I hope that by constantly repeating some hand-picked simple single-syllable words, they could pick them up and store them in their long-term memory and start scaffolding once their vocabulary bank helps them to understand a full basic sentence of daily talk. My biggest teaching philosophy for this particular group, or any group of learners, is that I don’t want to make them fear to learn or using English.
				   <br><br>
					For the second-youngest group, since they were all in their Elementary School age which tends to develop more at their cognition ability, they can be quick learners and constantly need something more appealing to stay focused, I played the song featured in a couple of classic American movies including Singing in the Rain, The Sound of Music. Having them imagined comprehending the words and phrases in the exact contexts was extremely essential since they cannot acquire a word into their vocabulary bank if they could not have a sense of it. By watching the movie character interacting while singing and talking throughout the video, I started to introduce the very basic new vocabularies by keep repeating that section and then asked them to stay focused by giving them some class signals such as a Quiet board. 
				   <br><br>
				   Subsequently, after they knew what the notion of those words was, I moved to the Pronunciation and Visualization part, which was the time I played the recorded voice in the dictionary and asked them to repeat and fix the errors if needed. For the Pronunciation mastery, at this age normally the kids start to pick up the same remembered words and mimic them when they face the same context, so I tried to get them to sing along or playing with the words. As for the Visualization phase, I do try to translate all of the learning words and lyrics into simple drawings I was a Graphic Design student, so I got no issues with increasing the aesthetic level to challenge their work more diligently on their paper. 
				   <br><br>
					As regards the oldest group of nuns I got to teach, since they were in their teenage age, keeping my lectures interesting was a must for me as a teacher! As the learning pace is much faster than the rest of the other nuns, this group could be tricky for me sometimes if I could not be well-prepared. However, I know that I can utilize that learning attitude to minimize the mistake they tended to make while learning English since they were in the progress of ego awareness and boosting. The first rule was no more repeating mistakes, and they got some intangible rewards if they can show improvements in class. I think at this age, all students want the one interacting with them can listen to their thoughts and rather stay at a superior level as a teacher, they want us to befriend them and take part in their work along. The activities for this group can be a more advanced and wide range of applications, from Jegal wooden stick with numbers to learn the less basic figures or composing a comic strip to grant them full control and develop their scattering ideas of using basic words into constructing a full-length basic sentence properly. At this age, I expect that they can perform easily at putting all the words together into a sentence to respond to any external stimulation or to express their minds.
				   <br><br>
					Here were some of my thoughts on my teaching experience at Jamyang Foundation, hopefully, you might find it helpful at some point. These days all the nations in the world are struggling with the Covid-19 pandemic, including India, I just got a text message from Ms. Elle Lohuis, the manager, that all the nuns were being safe so far and kept praying for all sentient beings. For me, that’s the most important thing to hear from them. In Vietnam, I pray for them and their loved ones to stay safe to get through this tragedy peacefully.
