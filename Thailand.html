					"- Hey! I’m in Bangkok, got a free day tomorrow. Do you know where to go out? Bangkok is full of tourists.

					<br>				
					- Why not? So now I'll pack my bag and please send me directions.
					<br>
					- Yep..."

				<br>
				A conversation between the two very shallow and impulsive youngsters. 
				And then, the following day, I packed up and took the bus to Hua Lamphong train station in Bangkok 
				to go to Nakhon Pathom...

				<h2 class="text-center">Volunteering at Pathom Asoke Community</h2>
				<br>
				<h5 class="text-justify"><em>Pathom Asoke Community is located in Nakhon Pathom province, 70km west of Bangkok; 
					usually, by train to get here or there is a highway running across Thailand. 
					Pathom Asoke is one of the branches of the Asoke Community spread across Thailand.</em></h5>
				<br>
				<p class="text-justify">
					Stepping into the monastery, I was nervous, I didn't know anyone in Asoke, 
					and when I asked, I knew that my friends had returned to Vietnam long ago. 
					Suffering has been my shy personality since I was a child, the kind of strange country unfamiliar to me.
					<br><br>
					“Shall I go back to Bangkok now? Warm blankets and soft mattresses, humming air conditioners, 
					it's just extreme here,” those were the things in my mind then. "No, I’ve already come so far, 
					I couldn’t leave anymore." So, I went in and asked if I could stay at the monastery for one day, just one day. 
					That's the story of a trip to attend a Scientific Research Conference in Bangkok that the school sponsored 
					(well, we don't have money to think about spending money just going out).
					<br><br>
					LoungPo Daodin taught me (in Thailand for a while, I later learned that "LuongPo" means "teacher" in Thai, 
					please allow me to use "LoungPo" from now on.) to get acquainted. He helped me a lot during my time at Pathom Asoke. 
					He always took the time to take me around and introduce the Asoke Open Community model. 
					I followed him because he was the only one comfortable communicating in English. 
					After many years of economic opening, even before Vietnam, besides well-known tourist attractions, 
					the remaining provinces in Thailand need help to popularize English. 
					<br><br>
					In Asoke, there are only trees and houses built by the owners. You hear right. In addition to significant 
					public works to serve the community, the Asoke people spend money to buy materials or pick up items from 
					the scrap yard to construct a house. Is it a true DIY spirit of today's kids? I used to help an uncle make 
					the front steps when I returned to Asoke in early 2019. Because of my eagerness to be more helpful, I stopped 
					by to satisfy my curiosity, but it didn't help much. He did it himself, picking up gravel, measuring, mixing cement, 
					and adjusting. 
					<br><br>
					It took all day to complete. Wow, how long would it take his whole house to finish? 
					I later learned that when he moved back to Asoke, he started to build. If there is no place to sleep, 
					Asoke will have a place to rest in the evening in a shared house for men. I also want to build a 
					house for myself when I'm older.
					<br><br>					
					In 2019, I stayed in Asoke for almost a month until my Tourist Visa nearly expired, 
					mainly working in the traditional soy sauce factory of Ms. Chong Chon in the morning and 
					helping with packaging and loading products at the Community Supermarket. Work starts at 7 am 
					and ends at 6 pm. Working at the soy sauce factory, Ms. Chong Chon taught me how to walk and 
					wash my hands to ensure hygiene in the fermentation area. She was a student at Chulalongkorn University, 
					one of the most prestigious schools in Thailand and Asia. Later she returned to Asoke to live and support 
					people to produce soy sauce to serve the community and sell it to generate income. My regular job every 
					morning was to stir and stir. I must flip through each jar and stir until the bean paste does not chunk so 
					the sauce will taste even without the smell of stale yeast. Having the soy sauce I made after distilling 
					the water, and I almost burst into tears.  That is the true spirit of self-service in Asoke. It is no coincidence 
					that from a very young age, children in Asoke have been resourceful and can take on much work on behalf of adults. 
					That's what kids raised in a city like mine look at with envy and shame.
					<br><br>
					In the afternoon, I stopped at the Community Supermarket in Asoke to help pack goods into 
					retail packages for local customers. The Asoke people are allowed to eat and drink and live 
					entirely without using the money within the community. However, Asoke sells its products to 
					local customers to pay for repairing and operating some resources that Asoke needs external help 
					with, such as electricity or clean water. Commerce also helps Asoke extend the Giving philosophy's 
					influence on more people. People can also buy local products at an affordable price and are safer 
					because the supply chain is shortened compared to products mass-produced in industrial zones far away 
					from where they live. It's so funny that a younger brother I know said that after a month in Asoke, eating 
					organic food, enjoying the smoke-free air, and using all-natural products for bathing or treatment, his face 
					was smooth without a single blemish, but the skin is ruddy. Hence, are you guys in a modern city like me 
					jealous after doing numerous skincare routines every night?
					<br><br>
					These days, Nakhon Pathom province and the whole of Thailand are being raged by the Covid epidemic, 
					especially since Thailand has an extensive border and many immigrants work from neighboring countries. 
					As far as I know from Uncle Chuan, the manager of the community supermarket, Asoke, has closed its doors 
					and only accepts visitors to shop from inside to ensure the community's safety. 
					I also messaged LoungPo Daodin and heard that he had gone home to take care of his mother and help 
					a few student groups in Bangkok because, in 2020, Thailand experienced a sizeable political dispute 
					across the country due to doubts about the current hierarchical government operations. As gratitude to 
					those who have raised me and given me everything I could ask for, I pray that everyone is still safe 
					and healthy in Thailand.
